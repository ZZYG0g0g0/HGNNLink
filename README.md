1. Set up the experimental environment based on `requirements.txt`.  
2. Create the `docs` and `dataset` folders, where `docs` stores the processed artifact documents, and `dataset` contains the dataset files.  
3. You can run the results for RQ1 in `./RQ1/HAN.py`, `./RQ1/HGT.py`, and `./RQ1/R-GCN.py`.  
4. You can run the results for RQ2 in `./RQ2/show_fig.py`.  
5. You can run the results for RQ4 in `./RQ4/GA.py` and `./RQ4/No_GA.py` (Note: The experimental code for RQ3 is the same as `./RQ1/HGT.py`).  
6. You need to download the `googlenewsvectorsnegative300` corpus from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leadbest/googlenewsvectorsnegative300) to complete the Word2Vec pretraining.  
7. Due to the large storage size of the dataset, it cannot be uploaded to GitHub. Instead, it has been uploaded to Google Drive and can be accessed at: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1G1iWKlwoL7SylSabUDG7oPoE_AbPiUi4).
